What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it? Your answer does not need to be in paragraphs. When you submit your homework form, you can link to a file in your Github repo where you wrote your answer.

LLMs in science could be good for predicting DNA sequences that code for proteins that prevent a variety of diseases. The DNA are sequential data and the relation of the data in the sequence does matter. Though there are cases where parts that are far apart matter a lot even though they are far apart. I would evalute an LLM in predicting a DNA sequence by having it predict a DNA sequence, build it, make a protein from it, and then see how effective that protein is. This loop of design, test, analyse is a gold standard for evaluating ML models.
